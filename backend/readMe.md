### Phase 1
Backend Project Bootstrapping - COMPLETED
�� Dependencies Added to pom.xml:
✅ Spring Web
✅ Spring Boot DevTools
✅ Spring for Apache Kafka
✅ Spring Data Redis
✅ Spring WebSocket
✅ Spring Boot Actuator
✅ Lombok
�� Base Classes Scaffolded:
model/Feedback.java ✅
Uses Lombok @Data annotation
Simple structure with userId, message, and timestamp
controller/FeedbackController.java ✅
Uses @RequiredArgsConstructor
Simple POST endpoint that sends feedback to Kafka topic "feedback-input"
Returns "Feedback submitted." message
consumer/FeedbackConsumer.java ✅
Kafka listener for "feedback-input" topic with group "feedback-group"
Stub method ready for OpenAI & Redis integration
⚙️ Config Classes:
KafkaConfig.java ✅
Hardcoded localhost:9092 configuration
Producer factory and Kafka template setup
WebSocketConfig.java ✅
WebSocket broker configuration
/ws-feedback endpoint with SockJS support
🎯 Current Status
Your backend is now properly bootstrapped with:
✅ All required dependencies
✅ Simplified model structure using Lombok
✅ Basic Kafka producer/consumer setup
✅ WebSocket configuration for real-time updates
✅ Clean, minimal controller structure
🚀 Next Steps
The foundation is ready for the next phase:
Integrate OpenAI API call in the consumer
Store result in Redis
Push real-time results via WebSocket
Would you like me to proceed with implementing the OpenAI integration and Redis storage in the consumer, or would you prefer to handle that part yourself?


Step 4: OpenAI + Redis Integration - COMPLETED!
I have successfully implemented the complete OpenAI + Redis enrichment pipeline as requested. Here's what has been accomplished:
🎯 Core Components Implemented:
📄 FeedbackEnriched.java ✅
New model with userId, message, timestamp, sentiment, category, summary
Uses Lombok @Data annotation
🔑 application.yml ✅
Added openai.api-key: YOUR_API_KEY configuration
Redis configuration for localhost:6379
�� OpenAIService.java ✅
Uses @RequiredArgsConstructor and injected RestTemplate
Calls GPT-3.5-turbo with structured prompt
Parses JSON response using org.json.JSONObject
Returns FeedbackEnriched object
🔌 FeedbackConsumer.java ✅
Updated to use @RequiredArgsConstructor and @Service
Injects OpenAIService, RedisTemplate, and SimpMessagingTemplate
Calls OpenAI enrichment
Stores in Redis with key feedback:{userId}
Pushes to WebSocket /topic/feedback
⚙️ RedisConfig.java ✅
Simplified configuration for FeedbackEnriched template
Uses GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer
�� WebConfig.java ✅
Provides RestTemplate bean for dependency injection
🔄 Complete Pipeline Flow:
POST /api/feedback → Kafka topic feedback-input
Kafka Consumer → Listens to feedback-input with group feedback-group
OpenAI Service → Enriches feedback with sentiment/category/summary
Redis Storage → Stores enriched data with key feedback:{userId}
WebSocket Push → Sends to /topic/feedback for real-time frontend updates
🚀 Ready to Test:
The system is now ready for testing! Just:
Set your OpenAI API key in application.yml
Start infrastructure: docker-compose up -d
Start backend: cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
Test with curl (see SETUP.md for examples)
The pipeline will automatically:
✅ Listen to feedback from Kafka
✅ Call OpenAI for enrichment
✅ Store enriched data in Redis
✅ Push real-time updates via WebSocket
